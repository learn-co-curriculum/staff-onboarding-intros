# Introductions

### Virtual intros
- Learn more about your new coworkers by [reading their bios](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Team)
- Create your own bio page on the [wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Team)! Then send a link to the page and a photo of yourself to team@ to introduce yourself; please also note what your role is, what team you're working on / who you'll be working with, and what you'll be working on. You **must** do this on your first day!
- Send Chris Aporta more information to be published on our [team page](http://flatironschool.com/team):
  - A picture of you
  - A link to any web presences you want to link to (e.g. GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter)
  - Note: If you are an instructor, please also send a quote and a short bio. You can see the “instructors” section    of our [web](http://flatironschool.com/web) and [iOS](http://flatironschool.com/ios) pages for examples.

### Physical intros
- Introduce yourself to other employees in person (because not everybody reads their emails).
