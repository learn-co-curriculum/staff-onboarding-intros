# Introductions

### First Day 

We're so excited you're here and we want to share the good news with everyone else. How to do that you ask? We use the program Confluence powered by the software Atlassian to store and share important information company wide.

So to start... 

- Learn more about your new coworkers by [reading their bios](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Team)
- After reading a few bios and getting the gist, create your own page on the [wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ER/Team)! 
- Once you've created a page, send a link to the page and a photo of yourself to team@flatironschool.com to introduce yourself; please also note what your role is, what team you're working on / who you'll be working with, and what you'll be working on. You **must** do this on your first day!
